#Pairs Game

A small picture matching game to test my understanding of DOM manipulation,
arrays, and objects. 

With variable difficulties and toggleable options, this will force me to leave my code more adaptable that I have done in excercises so far. 

Also a project for me to practice using GIT and GitHub as I will be trying to push changes during development using these tools.
